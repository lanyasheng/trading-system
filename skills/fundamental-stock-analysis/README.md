# Fundamental Stock Analysis (OpenClaw Skill)

This is an **OpenClaw skill** for structured fundamental equity analysis and peer ranking.

It applies a scoring playbook focused on:
- Business quality
- Balance-sheet safety
- Cash-flow quality
- Valuation context
- Risk and confidence modifiers

## What this skill does

Use this skill to:
- Analyze one or more stock tickers from a fundamentals perspective
- Compare peers and rank them
- Produce a decisive, risk-aware verdict with confidence level

The workflow is playbook-driven and explicitly marks missing data as `NA` instead of guessing.

## How to use

### Trigger cases
Use this skill when the user asks things like:
- “Analyze ticker X fundamentally”
- “Compare these 3 stocks and pick the best”
- “Give me a fundamentals-based verdict for [ticker]”

### Required behavior
1. Read `references/playbook.md` before starting.
2. Follow the playbook steps in order.
3. For multi-ticker requests, analyze each ticker first, then rank peers.
4. Always include confidence and call out stale/conflicting data.
5. Append the required machine-readable JSON block at the end.

## Output expectations
- Be decisive, not vague.
- Separate quality, balance-sheet safety, and valuation.
- Never fabricate missing metrics.
- Include data-source links in a final `Sources` section.
